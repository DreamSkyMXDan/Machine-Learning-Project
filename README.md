# Machine-Learning-Project
This is to demo the machine learning projects that I have worked on. It includes housing price prediction, payment fraud detection, movie recommendation, etc.

## Projects:

- Payment Fraud Detection [payment_fraud_detection](https://github.com/DreamSkyMXDan/Machine-Learning-Project/blob/master/project/Fraud_Detection_Exercise.ipynb)
- Boston Housing Market Prediction [boston housing price prediction](https://github.com/DreamSkyMXDan/Machine-Learning-Project/blob/master/project/boston_housing.ipynb)
- Finding Donors [supervised learning](https://github.com/DreamSkyMXDan/Machine-Learning-Project/blob/master/project/finding_donors.ipynb) (data exploration, preprocessing data, shuffle and split data, train and test model with SVM, AdaBoost and Naive Bayes)
