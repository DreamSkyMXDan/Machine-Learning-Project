# Machine-Learning-Project
This is to demo the machine learning projects that I have worked on. It includes housing price prediction, payment fraud detection, movie recommendation, etc.

## Projects:

- Payment Fraud Detection [payment_fraud_detection](https://github.com/DreamSkyMXDan/Machine-Learning-Project/blob/master/project/Fraud_Detection_Exercise.ipynb)
- Boston Housing Market Prediction [boston housing price prediction](https://github.com/DreamSkyMXDan/Machine-Learning-Project/blob/master/project/boston_housing.ipynb)
- Finding Donors [supervised learning](https://github.com/DreamSkyMXDan/Machine-Learning-Project/blob/master/project/finding_donors.ipynb) (data exploration, preprocessing data, shuffle and split data, train and test model with SVM, AdaBoost and Naive Bayes)
- Customers Segments [unsupervised learning](https://github.com/DreamSkyMXDan/Machine-Learning-Project/blob/master/project/customer_segments.ipynb) (Data Exploration, Preprocessing, PCA, KMeans, Gaussian Mixture Model clustering algorithm, Feature Recovery)
- Population Segmentation with SageMaker [unsupervised learning](https://github.com/DreamSkyMXDan/Machine-Learning-Project/blob/master/project/Pop_Segmentation_Exercise.ipynb) (Data loading, data analysis, data normalization, data modeling, PCA, data transformation, Data Visualization, K-means)
- Sentiment Analysis with SageMaker [RNN] (https://github.com/DreamSkyMXDan/Machine-Learning-Project/blob/master/project/Sentiment%20Analysis%20SageMaker%20Project.ipynb) (Data preprocessing, Upload Data to S3, Build and Train the Pytorch Model, Deploy the model for testing, Deploy the model for webApp, Use the model for webApp)
